# Identify the type of the Problem:

1. Deformation problem: The question asks for deflection, so we need to know lateral load and deformation.
2. Load type: distributed lateral load due to gravity and a bending moment
3. bar type: Compound, including one segmented senario with a moment and a continuously varying senario with the load
4. working direction: reverse [where I find appropriate properties for a given outcome (no deflection at the tip)]

# Identify the procedures according to the type:
## Initial Thoughts
As the general formula for deflection is {{\frac{d^2 v} {dx^2}=\frac{M(x)} {EI}}}, we need to calculate {{M(x)}} because it is the only variable that changes with position.
## Finding {{M(x)}} for both senarios:
### Segmented (the bending moment)

1. Make a cut within each segment and solve the FBD to find M(x) in each
2. Use the formula for deflection to get deflection formula for each segment. 2nd diffeq, 2 initial values (use ??)
* Don't plug in values out of region!
3. calculate v for segmented at L

### continuously varying (the gravity load)

1. replace the distributed load with resultant force and calculate M(x) in the FBD
* use {q} (unit N/m) as the factor as the value is constant along the bar
2. Use the formula for deflection
3.


* don't treat them as single problem. You will die calculating!!!
