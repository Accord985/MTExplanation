# Identify the type of the Problem:

1. Failure analysis: we want to know the load to test for failure or possible buckling force of the beam.
2. Load type: compressive axial load, uniform along the beam, and may result in buckling
3. bar type: nonisotropic (seam)
4. working direction: reverse [where I find appropriate forces so that the beam does not fail]

<S>
# Identify the procedures according to the type:

1. Make the cut and find the force along the x axis (defined by ourselves)
2. Calculate the force when the beam [a] buckles or [b] fails due to compressive force at the seam
3. Combine the constraints and take the strictest one for the force

<S>
# Step 1: Finding the force along the x axis
##RESOURCE fig1
$ N+F=0
$ N=-F(0<x<L)
Thus compressive force is F anywhere on the beam.

<S>
# Step 2: Find the maximum force before buckling/failure due to pressure
## Buckling force (for one solid support)
$ F_c=\frac{EI\pi^2} {4L^2}
* There is only one support on the beam for this question. Remember the definition of support: Prevents movements for both horizontal and vertical direction along with rotation. Then, only the ground provides such support.
where {{I}} equals to the second moment of inertia for a ring:
$ I=\frac{\pi} {4}(R_1^4-R_2^4)
Therefore,
$ F_c=\frac{E(R_1^4-R_2^4)\pi^3}{16L^2}
and plugging in the numbers, we get {{F<F_c=13.8\text{N} }}
## Compressive load failure
In this case,
$ \sigma_x=\frac{N}{A}=\frac{F}{\pi(R_1^2-R_2^2)}, \sigma_y=\tau=0
Thus, {{\sigma_{y\theta} }} at the seam is
$ \sigma_{y\theta}=\sigma_{\text{av}}-\frac{\sigma_x-\sigma_y}{2}\cos(2\theta)-\tau\sin(2\theta)=\frac{F}{2\pi(R_1^2-R_2^2)}(1-\cos(2\theta))
and {{\tau_\theta}} at the seam is
$ \tau_\theta=-\frac{\sigma_x-\sigma_y}{2}\sin(2\theta)+\tau\cos(2\theta)=-\frac{F}{2\pi(R_1^2-R_2^2)}\sin(2\theta)
* Here {{\theta}} is {{25\degree}}. You need to check if the angle is the one that you need in the formula!
Thus, the constraints for F is
$ \begin{cases} \sigma_{y\theta}<\text{UTS} \\ |\tau_\theta|<\text{USS} \end{cases}
or
$ \begin{cases} F<\frac{\text{UTS}}{1-\cos(2\theta)}\cdot2\pi(R_1^2-R_2^2) \\ F<\frac{\text{USS}}{\sin(2\theta)}\cdot2\pi(R_1^2-R_2^2) \end{cases}
Plugging in the numbers,
$ \begin{cases} F<62\text{N} \\ F<19.3\text{N} \end{cases}

<S>
# Step 3: Combine the requirements
From previous calculations, the strictest constraints is {{F<13.8\text{N} }} (smallest maximum value for {{F}})
Thus, the maximum force allowed is {{13.8\text{N} }} .
